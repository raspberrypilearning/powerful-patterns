## Your idea

Use this step to plan your powerful pattern. You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing or writing, or however you like!

### Get started

--- task ---

Open the [Powerful patterns starter project](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/powerful-patterns-starter){:target="_blank"} project. 
--- /task ---

### Setup your project

--- task ---

Choose a size and a background colour.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 6
line_highlights: 7-8
---
def setup():
    size(400, 400)  # Choose a size 
    background(255, 255, 255)  # Try different numbers to change the colour 

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project to see the changes. 

The maximum amount of red, green, or blue is `255`. Make sure all your `background` colour values are between `0` and `255`.
