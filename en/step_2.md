### Why are you making your powerful pattern ?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of the pattern you are creating.

It could be:
- To express something significant from your or your family's culture(s)
- To recreate a geometric pattern that means something to you
- Something you create with a group of people to send a certain message (for example, a quilt)
- To show something fascinating about about a hobby (for example, art, science, nature, music)
