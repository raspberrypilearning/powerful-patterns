## Your idea

Use this step to plan your powerful pattern. You can plan by just thinking; tinkering; drawing or writing; or however you like!

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">Patterns often have cultural or religious significance. Certain geometric shapes and positions can have symbolic or sacred meanings. Whether the pattern is in architecture, fabric, art, cooking, or something else, the process of making the pattern can also be significant.</p>

### Why are you making your powerful pattern ?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of the pattern you are creating.

It could be:
- To express something significant from your or your family's culture(s)
- To recreate a geometric pattern that means something to you
- Something you create with a group of people to send a certain message (for example, a quilt)
- To show something fascinating about about a hobby (for example, art, science, nature, music)

**Tip:** Patterns are everywhere! You might choose to get inspiration by going on a pattern hunt around your physical environment or online.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">As well as having symbolic meaning, patterns show the mathematics that is all around us. Mathematics helps us make sense of the world around us and we can find mathematical patterns in art, literature and nature. </p>

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your pattern for (your **audience**).

What is the significance of your pattern? Will the colours, shapes or way the pattern is repeated mean something special to your audience? 

If yur are creating a pattern as a group, does your motif need to be a certain size or shape to fit with other parts of a bigger pattern?
